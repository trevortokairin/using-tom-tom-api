# Leveraging Geocoding APIs for Business Analytics
Overview:
This project involves creating Python functions to retrieve geographic coordinates and addresses using the TomTom geocoding APIs. The key capabilities include:

Finding coordinates for addresses
Submit addresses to API
Retrieve latitude and longitude
Handle errors and malformed responses
Finding addresses for coordinates
Submit latitudes and longitudes to API
Retrieve corresponding addresses
Handle errors and malformed responses
The functions serve as reusable modules to access the APIs and wrangle the JSON responses into clean Pandas data frames.

Business Implications:

Location analytics is crucial for logistics, real estate, urban planning, geospatial visualization, and more
Easy access to geocoding simplifies incorporating location data into business analytics and models
Analyzing customer addresses can inform site selection, marketing campaigns, delivery routes etc.
Converting coordinates into human-readable addresses enables interactive mapping applications
In summary, leveraging geocoding APIs provides business analysts with the building blocks for integrating geographic intelligence into data science workflows and dashboards.
